This lab shows how to setup the JSF aware about the Spring components in order to use the Spring Dependency Injection.
It is built with Maven which provides this project to be IDE agnostic. So, it is simple to build and run it:

* mvn clean install
* mvn jetty:run

Then, open the http://localhost:8080/jsf-spring in some web browser.
